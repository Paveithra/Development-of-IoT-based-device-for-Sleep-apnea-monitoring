### **Sleep Apnea Monitoring Kit**

_This project is a simple and low-cost system to help monitor sleep apnea using three main sensors: DHT11, LM35, and an ECG sensor. It collects real-time data like body temperature, ambient temperature, humidity, and heart rate to observe patterns during sleep._

**Components Used**

- DHT11 Sensor – for ambient temperature and humidity
- LM35 Sensor – for body temperature
- ECG Sensor – for heart rate monitoring
- Microcontroller – like Arduino Uno
- Wires and Breadboard
- Power Supply – USB or battery

**Features**

- Measures and displays real-time data
- Monitors heart rate, temperature, and humidity
- Can help detect irregularities during sleep
- Easy to build and portable

**How to Use**

- Connect the sensors to the microcontroller 
- Upload the Arduino code to the board.
- Open the Serial Monitor to see the live data.
- Optionally, connect a display to view data directly.

**Example Output**

_**Body Temperature: 36.8°C  
Room Temperature: 27.5°C  
Humidity: 60%  
Heart Rate: 75 bpm**_  

**Future Scope**

- Add cloud support to store data
- Build a mobile app for viewing graphs
- Include alert system for apnea events
- Add a motion sensor to detect sleep posture
